            <h1 id="home">Grid9 Documentation</h1>
            <p class="docs-data">
                To explain Grid9 in one sentence it is an esoteric interpreted language made in Nim based on a 3x3 grid of zeros and ones.
            </p>
            <p class="docs-data">
                The whole language is based around this 3x3 grid for a total of 9 cells in the grid. In any of the cells its value can be 0 or 1.
                You can interact with these cells by setting them (s) flipping them (f) or setting all the cells to a value (a).
                With all of these ways you can interact with the cells you may wonder what you can do with them and the answer to that is that every outputable character in this language has its own unique combination of cells.
                Now you may wonder why 9 cells why not 8 like the size of a byte. Well the answer to that is well there is non, but some useful things you can do with that 9th cell is use it for your own varible storage so you can store a zero or one that may be used to sway logic.
            </p>

            <p class="docs-data">
                This language doesnt stop at just being able to change a few numbers, there is statements, controll of flow operators, and more.
            </p>

            <h1>Cell Modification</h1>
            <br>

            <h2 id="set">Set</h2>
            <p class="docs-data">
                The set command is used to set a cell to a value.
            </p>
            <p class="docs-data">
                The syntax for this command is "s" followed by the cell id and then the value you want to set it to.
                This unlike the flip command sets the value for certainy of a cells value.
            </p>
            <p class="docs-data">
                For example if you wanted to set cell 0 to 1 you would do "s01". If you wanted to set cell 8 to 0 you would do "s80".
            </p>
            <br>

            <h2 id="flip">Flip</h1>
            <p class="docs-data">
                The flip command is used to flip a cell to a value.
            </p>
            <p class="docs-data">
                The syntax for this command is "f" followed by the cell id that you would like to flip (0-8).
                This unlike the set command flips the value with uncertainy of a cells value.
            </p>
            <p class="docs-data">
                For example if you wanted to flip cell 2 you would do "f2". If you wanted to flip cell 8 you would do "f4".
            </p>
            <br>

            <h2 id="set-all">Set-all</h2>
            <p class="docs-data">
                The set-all command is used to set a cell to a value.
            </p>
            <p class="docs-data">
                The syntax for this command is "s" followed by the cell id and then the value you want to set it to.
                This flips all cells with certainy of a cells value.
            </p>
            <p class="docs-data">
                For example if you wanted all the cells to have the value 1 you would do "s1". If you wanted all the cells to have the value 0 you would do "s0".
            </p>
            <br>

            <h1>IO</h1>
            <br>

            <h2 id="print">Print</h2>
            <p class="docs-data">
                The print command is used to print the grid glyth character to the console.
            </p>
            <p class="docs-data">
                Now this command needs a little explanation to understand it, but every outputable character has it own combination on the grid and those are called "glyths".
                The print command converts these "glyths" into the single character that they represent.
                Also the print command will print the current queue instead of the current glyth if the queue contains anything.
                The syntax for this command is "p".
            </p>
            <p class="docs-data">
                For example the character "a" is represented by the cells 000000010. If you were to set cell 7 (the cell ids start at 0) with the command "f7" and then do print (p) it would print "a".
                All that code together would look like this: "f7p".
            </p>
            <br>

            <h2 id="queue">Queue</h2>
            <p class="docs-data">
                The queue command is used to print multiple "glyhs" or characters together.
            </p>
            <p class="docs-data">
                The syntax for this command is "qs" to add a glyph to the queue and "qc" to completly clear the queue.
            </p>
            <p class="docs-data">
                For example say you have the letter "r" on the current glyth (which is 000010011) and you want to print two of them next to each other.
                To do this you would do "f4f7f8qs" and then "f4f7f8qs" again then "p" to print the two "r"s next to each other on the same line.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h2 id="give">Give</h2>
            <p class="docs-data">
                The give command is for users to give a glyth pattern as a input to the script.
            </p>
            <p class="docs-data">
                The syntax for this command is just "g".
            </p>
            <p class="docs-data">
                For example if you wanted to make a simple glyth to character converter you would do "gp"
                What this would do is it would take input and print out the character as output.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h1>Logic</h1>
            <br>

            <h2 id="if">If</h2>
            <p class="docs-data">
                The if command is used to check if a cell is a zero or a one.
            </p>
            <p class="docs-data">
                The syntax for this command is "i" followed by the cell id and then a "=" or a "!" for a not equal then the value of the cell you are testing for.
                Remember to also to close a if statement, to do this you have to use a "}"
            </p>
            <p class="docs-data">
                For example if you wanted to test cell 2 for a zero you would do "i2=0 SOME CODE }". If you wanted to test cell 7 for not a one you would do "i7!1 SOME CODE }".
            </p>
            <br>

            <h2 id="while">While</h2>
            <p class="docs-data">
                The while command is used to loop in your code as long as its conditions are met.
            </p>
            <p class="docs-data">
                The syntax for this command is similar to the if command, the syntax for it is a "w" followed by the cell id and then a "=" or a "!" for a not equal then the value of the cell you are testing for.
                Remember to also to close a while statement, to do this you have to use a "]"
            </p>
            <p class="docs-data">
                For example if you wanted to loop until a cell had the value 1 you would do "w1=1 SOME CODE ]". If you wanted to loop until a cell had the value 0 you would do "w1!1 SOME CODE ]".
            </p>
            <br>

            <h2 id="exit">Exit</h2>
            <p class="docs-data">
                The exit command is used to exit the current while loop.
            </p>
            <p class="docs-data">
                The syntax for this command is just "e".
            </p>
            <p class="docs-data">
                For example if you wanted to loop while cell 3 has the value 0 you would do "w3=0 SOME CODE ]", but if you would want to exit it you would do "w3=0 SOME CODE e ]" This will only run once because there is no conditial statements preventing the exit command from being ran.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h1 id="misk">Misk</h1>
            <br>

            <h2 id="back">Back</h2>
            <p class="docs-data">
                The back command is used to go back to previous instructions in the code.
            </p>
            <p class="docs-data">
                The syntax for this command is "b" followed by the number of instructions you want to go back.
            </p>
            <p class="docs-data">
                For example if you wanted to go back 3 instructions you would do "b3".
            </p>
            <br>

            <h2 id="terminate">Terminate</h2>
            <p class="docs-data">
                The terminate command is used to terminate the program.
            </p>
            <p class="docs-data">
                The syntax for this command is just "t".
            </p>
            <p class="docs-data">
                For example if you wanted to terminate the program if a condition is met you would do "i0=0t}f7p" As you can see the code "f7p" will never get ran because on default all cells are 0 and that condition is true so it terminates the program.
