LETS CREATE A INFINITE LOOP BUT WITH A EXIT COMMAND (X) SO IT JUST RUNS ONCE

w0=0
f7
p
x
]

IF WE WANTED TO WE COULD USE OUR LOGIC FROM EARLIER TO HAVE IT LOOP A FEW TIMES WITH IF STATEMENTS


LETS ALSO SHOW HOW TO USE THE BACK COMMAND (B). WE WILL SHOW HOW TO MAKE WHAT WE MADE IN EXAMPLE 2 WITH LOOPS

f7
f8
p
b4

AS YOU CAN SEE IT GOES BACK 4 CHARACTERS BECAUSE WE HAVE A 4 AFTER IT (IT IGNORES COMMENTS AND WHITESPACE) AND IT GOES BACK TO THE f8
