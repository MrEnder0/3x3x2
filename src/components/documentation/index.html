                <h2>Basic Description</h2>

                <p class="docs-data">
                    To explain Grid9 in one sentence it is an esoteric interpreted language made in Nim based on a 3x3 grid of cells for a total of 9 cells in the grid where the values of the cells consist of zeros and ones.
                </p>
                <p class="docs-data">
                    You can interact with these cells by setting them (s) flipping them (f) or setting all the cells to a value (a).
                    With all of these ways you can interact with the cells you may wonder what you can do with them and the answer to that is that every output able character in this language has its unique combination of cells.
                    Now you may wonder why 9 cells why not 8 like the size of a byte. Well, the answer to that is well it is non, but some useful things you can do with that 9th cell use it for your variable storage so you can store a zero or one that may be used to sway logic.
                </p>

                <p class="docs-data">
                    This language doesn't stop at just being able to change a few numbers; there are statements, control of flow operators, and more.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h2 id="set">Set</h2>
                <p class="docs-data">
                    The set command is used to set a cell to a value.
                </p>
                <p class="docs-data">
                    The syntax for this command is "s" followed by the cell id and then the value you want to set it to.
                    This unlike the flip command sets the value for certain of a cell's value.
                </p>
                <p class="docs-data">
                    For example, if you wanted to set cell 0 to 1 you would run the code below.
                </p>
                <br>

                <div style=width:5%;min-width:50px; class="code-block">

                <p class="docs-data">
                    The flip command is used to flip a cell to a value.
                </p>
                <p class="docs-data">
                    The syntax for this command is "f" followed by the cell id that you would like to flip (0-8).
                    This unlike the set command flips the value with the uncertainty of a cell's value.
                </p>
                <p class="docs-data">
                    For example, if you wanted to flip cell 2 you would run the code below.

                <p class="docs-data">
                    The set-all command is used to set a cell to a value.

                <p class="docs-data">
                    The syntax for this command is "s" followed by the cell id and then the value you want to set it to.
                    This flips all cells with the certainty of a cell's value.
                </p>
                <p class="docs-data">
                    For example, if you wanted all the cells to have the value 1 you would run the code below.

                <h2 id="print">Print</h2>
                <p class="docs-data">
                    The print command is used to print the grid glyph character to the console.
                </p>
                <p class="docs-data">
                    Now, this command needs a little explanation to understand it, but every output-able character has its combination on the grid and those are called "glyphs".
                    The print command converts these "glyphs" into the single character that they represent.
                    Also, the print command will print the current queue instead of the current glyph if the queue contains anything.
                    The syntax for this command is "p".
                </p>
                <p class="docs-data">
                    For example, the character "a" is represented by 000000010. If you were to flip cell 7 (the cell ids start at 0) and then it would print "a" like in the code shown below.
                </p>
                <br>

                <div style=width:5%;min-width:50px; class="code-block">

                <p class="docs-data">
                    The queue command is used to print multiple "glyphs" or characters together.
                </p>
                <p class="docs-data">
                    The syntax for this command is "qs" to add a glyph to the queue and "qc" to completely clear the queue.
                </p>
                <p class="docs-data">
                    For example say you want to print two "r" letters next to each other.
                    To do this you would want to make the glyph for "r" save it in the queue and then again save it and then print it to get the output "rr" like in the code shown below.

                <p class="docs-data">
                    The if command is used to check if a cell is a zero or a one.

                <p class="docs-data">
                    The syntax for this command is "i" followed by the cell id and then a "=" or a "!" for a not equal to the value of the cell you are testing for.
                    Remember to also close an if statement, to do this you have to use a "}"

                <p class="docs-data">
                    The syntax for this command is similar to the if command, the syntax for it is a "w" followed by the cell id and then a "=" or a "!" for a not equal then the value of the cell you are testing for.

                    These config options are used to change the way Grid9 interacts with your code.
                    For example, you can run advancedParse which will make the program start slower but can fix issues in your code.
                    The options can also allow you to see more technical information about the program. For example, turning on echoGridMod will print you the grid after every instruction that modifies the cells in some way.
