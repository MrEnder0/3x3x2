## Future plans:
Note in between updates there may be other smaller changes. Also none of these are in any particular order.

### High priority
 - Add logging system for debugging errors and script information.
 - Use booleans instead of strings for the grid array for better memory ussage and performance.
 - Allow while nesting

### Low priority
 - Create a compiled html for local documentation
 - Add logging system for debugging errors and script information.
 - Clean up bad code and comment on more complex parts for readability.

## Syntax Example:
Here is a example of a conditional statement.

```grid9
i0=1f7p}
```

This checks if cell 0 = 1 and then if so it will flip cell 7 and print the glyth value.
