## Future plans:
Note in between updates there may be other smaller changes.

### High priority
 - Add more options to the installer
 - Allow while nesting
 - Make a update command for the cli tool

### Low priority
 - Use booleans instead of strings for the grid array for better memory ussage and performance.
 - Add ability to use q (queue) in any command that accepts input as a input
 - Add error logging system.

## Syntax Example:
Here is a example of a conditional statement.

```grid9
i0=1f7p}
```

This checks if cell 0 = 1 and then if so it will flip cell 7 and print the glyth value.
