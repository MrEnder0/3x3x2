## Future plans

Note in between updates there may be other smaller changes. Also none of these are in any particular order.

### High priority

- Allow while nesting
- Add more checks to the advanced parse option

### Low priority

- Add code blocks to the documentation.
- Create install script for Linux.
- Create github action to test code on push.

## Syntax Example

Here is a example of a conditional statement.

```grid9
i0=1f7p}
```

This checks if cell 0 = 1 and then if so it will flip cell 7 and print the glyth value.
