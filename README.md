## Syntax Example
Here is a example of a conditional statement.

i0=1f7p}

This checks if cell 0 = 1 and then if so it will flip cell 7 and print the glyth value.

## Plans
Note in between updates there may be other smaller changes.

### High priority
 - Will allow while nesting
 - Will make installer in inno setup.

### Low priority
 - Will use booleans instead of strings for the grid array for better memory ussage and performance.
 - Will added error logging system.
